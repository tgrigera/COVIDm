* Building

If you download a release tarball, it's enough to do

: ./configure
: make
: sudo make install

This installs in =/usr/local=, you can give =--prefix= to the
~configure~ script to change this.  The development versions of the
following libraries are required to build, you will get a configure
error if they are missing:

 - GNU Scientific library

** Compile from repository

To compile from a clone of the repository you need to install
=autotools=.  First generate the ~configure~ script with

: autoreconf -if

then proceed with ~configure~ and ~make~ as above.
