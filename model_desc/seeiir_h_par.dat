# Now come the number of descendants of each node at each level.
# A negative number (-M)  indicates fluctuating number:
# absolute value of that number then will be the maximum number, give then the
# wheights of the numbers from 1 to M
#
# Level 4 has only 1 node (global community)
# Number of level 3 nodes ("towns")
5
# Number of level 2 nodes per level 3 node  ("neighborhoods" per "town")
5
# Number of level 1 nodes ("families") per level 2 node ("neighborhood")
  1280
# Number of level 0 nodes (individuals) per family, this fluctuates from 1 to 6:
